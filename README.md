## Pairing Matrix

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/TheoLeanse/pairing-matrix/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/TheoLeanse/pairing-matrix)

Organises a student body into teams of two, accounting for odd numbers, previous pair history and personal differences. Test-driven in Rails with nice SOLID principles.

This is my personal clone of a team crash course in Git workflow and Kanban (we used Trello and Waffle), while polishing understanding of ActiveRecord associations in Rails and encapsulating app logic in Service Objects.
